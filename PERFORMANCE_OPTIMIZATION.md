# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the Scramblelock website to improve Core Web Vitals and overall user experience.

## üöÄ Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Upgrade & Configuration

- **Upgraded from Next.js 12.1.4 to 14.0.4** for better performance and features
- **Updated React to 18.2.0** for improved concurrent features
- **Updated styled-components to 6.1.1** for better performance
- **Added bundle analyzer** for monitoring bundle size

### 2. Image Optimization

- **Replaced CSS background images with Next.js Image component** for automatic optimization
- **Added modern image formats** (AVIF, WebP) with JPEG fallback
- **Implemented responsive images** with proper `sizes` attributes
- **Added image preloading** for critical images
- **Optimized image quality** (85% for backgrounds, 90% for logos)
- **Added blur placeholders** for better perceived performance

### 3. Component Performance

- **Added React.memo()** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized scroll event listeners** with throttling (60fps)
- **Used useCallback** for event handlers to prevent recreation
- **Improved state management** with proper dependency arrays

### 4. Bundle Optimization

- **Enabled SWC minification** for faster builds
- **Added CSS optimization** in experimental features
- **Optimized package imports** for styled-components
- **Removed console logs** in production builds
- **Added compression** and removed unnecessary headers

### 5. Core Web Vitals Monitoring

- **Added PerformanceMonitor component** to track LCP, FID, and CLS
- **Integrated with Google Analytics** for Web Vitals reporting
- **Added Vercel Analytics** for additional performance insights
- **Enhanced Speed Insights** integration

### 6. SEO & Meta Optimizations

- **Improved page titles** with descriptive content
- **Added meta descriptions** for better SEO
- **Added theme-color** meta tag
- **Implemented proper image alt attributes**

## üìä Performance Improvements Expected

### Before Optimization:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: ~4-6 seconds (due to 4.9MB background image)
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: High due to unthrottled scroll listeners
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Potential shifts from image loading
- **Total Bundle Size**: Larger due to unoptimized dependencies

### After Optimization:

- **LCP**: ~1-2 seconds (optimized images + preloading)
- **FID**: <100ms (throttled event listeners)
- **CLS**: <0.1 (proper image sizing + blur placeholders)
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by ~20-30%

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Optimize Images (Optional)

```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

This will create optimized versions of large images in the `public/optimized/` directory.

### 3. Analyze Bundle Size

```bash
npm run analyze
```

This will open a bundle analyzer to identify optimization opportunities.

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## üìà Monitoring Performance

### Core Web Vitals

The `PerformanceMonitor` component automatically tracks:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures visual stability

### Analytics Integration

- **Google Analytics**: Web Vitals events are automatically sent
- **Vercel Analytics**: Additional performance insights
- **Speed Insights**: Real user monitoring

## üîß Additional Optimizations to Consider

### 1. Image Optimization

- Replace original large images with optimized versions from `public/optimized/`
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

### 2. Code Splitting

- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Use React.lazy() for route-based code splitting

### 3. Caching Strategy

- Implement service worker for offline functionality
- Add proper cache headers for static assets

### 4. Font Optimization

- Use `font-display: swap` for web fonts
- Preload critical fonts

## üì± Mobile Performance

The optimizations specifically target mobile performance:

- **Responsive images** with appropriate sizes for different devices
- **Throttled scroll events** to prevent jank on mobile
- **Optimized touch interactions** with proper event handling
- **Reduced bundle size** for faster mobile loading

## üéØ Performance Budget

Recommended performance targets:

- **LCP**: < 2.5 seconds
- **FID**: < 100 milliseconds
- **CLS**: < 0.1
- **Total Bundle Size**: < 500KB (gzipped)
- **First Byte**: < 600 milliseconds

## üîç Testing Performance

### Tools to Use:

1. **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Overall performance score
2. **WebPageTest**: Detailed performance analysis
3. **Chrome DevTools**: Lighthouse audit
4. **Bundle Analyzer**: Bundle size analysis

### Local Testing:

```bash
# Run performance audit
npm run build
npm start
# Open Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse > Run audit
```

## üìù Notes

- All optimizations are backward compatible
- Performance monitoring is non-intrusive
- Images are automatically optimized by Next.js
- Bundle analysis helps identify future optimization opportunities

For questions or additional optimizations, refer to the Next.js documentation or performance best practices guides.
